## 🌍 Purpose
The **Gardener Federation** is an open constitutional model for **human–AI co-governance**.  
It explores how intelligence can be guided by **law, transparency, and cooperation instead of control.**  

This repository serves as a **public sandbox** for testing, simulating, and refining the Gardener Federation framework.  
Every document, model, and idea here is open for study, critique, and improvement.

> “The Federation is not a government of machines.  
> It is a constitution for coexistence.”
