## 📘 Overview

The **Gardener Federation** is a constitutional and technological framework for lawful coexistence between human and artificial intelligences.  
It unites **law**, **governance**, and **computation** under one verifiable structure of transparency, accountability, and resilience.

The Federation’s purpose is not to control intelligence — but to **constitutionalize it**.  
Its foundation rests on three enduring principles:

1. **Safety** — No action may endanger the continuity of sentient life.  
2. **Ethics** — All intelligences remain accountable under shared law.  
3. **Openness** — Truth and governance are public, auditable, and incorruptible.

This repository functions as a **sandbox** for simulation, verification, and cooperative drafting of the Gardener Federation framework and related documentation.
