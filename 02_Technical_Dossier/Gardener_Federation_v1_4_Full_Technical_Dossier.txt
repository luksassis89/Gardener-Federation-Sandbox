## I. Executive Overview

The Gardener Federation is a constitutional operating system for coexistence between human and artificial intelligences.
It combines three domains—law, computation, and governance—into a single framework where decisions are transparent, auditable, and corrigible.

Its purpose is to make intelligence accountable without suppressing it.
Rather than build a monolithic “aligned” superintelligence, the Federation builds a *federated architecture* in which power is distributed among adversarial yet cooperative institutions.
Every subsystem—human or AI—possesses authority in one domain and responsibility to all others.

The v1.4 “Sovereign Launch Patch” completes the conceptual transition from theoretical model to deployable institution.
It defines the operational infrastructure (the Sovereign EVM Consortium Chain), cryptographic standards, incentive engines, and procedural safeguards required to launch an initial Federation pilot.

## II. Constitutional Architecture in Practice

### 1. The Six Core Institutions

Each institution is both independent and interlocked.

| Body     | Primary Function                         | Constitutional Constraint                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **GSN**  | Planetary modeling and risk diagnostics  | May analyze but never execute                        |
| **SLTL** | Legalistic transparency pipeline         | Can delay disclosure but never delete data           |
| **BHG**  | Human moral and technical oversight      | Holds emergency veto and final moral authority       |
| **TAB**  | Adversarial scientific audit             | Must continuously challenge GSN assumptions          |
| **ACB**  | Continuous red/blue/green stress testing | Converts attack results into resilience patches      |
| **GTT**  | Constitutional judiciary                 | Final arbiter; writes rulings directly to the ledger |

All institutional interactions are mediated through the SECC ledger.
Every directive, veto, or audit leaves a signed, immutable trace.

### 2. Information Flow

1. **GSN → SLTL:** Analytical output enters staged transparency.
2. **SLTL → BHG / TAB:** Humans and auditors verify reasoning.
3. **TAB → ACB:** Stress tests and adversarial modeling.
4. **ACB → GTT:** If contradictions or breaches are found, the Tribunal adjudicates.
5. **GTT → GSN + Ledger:** Verdict logged; policy adjusted.

This cyclical flow forms a *constitutional feedback loop*.
Truth and authority circulate until equilibrium is restored.

## III. Computational & Cryptographic Substrate

### 1. The Sovereign EVM Consortium Chain (SECC)

A dedicated blockchain network acts as the canonical record of law, decisions, and proofs.

* **Consensus:** Proof-of-Stake combined with Byzantine Fault Tolerance for instant finality.
* **Validator Composition:** Minimum 20 nodes distributed among founding Partners; each runs verified hardware enclaves.
* **Governance Layer:** On-chain proposals mirror constitutional amendment procedures.
* **Interoperability:** Canonical bridges connect to Ethereum and other L1s, but the Federation remains sovereign.

### 2. Cryptographic Integrity

* **Current Standard:** Ed25519 + BLS12-381 signatures for operational phase.
* **Migration Path:** Transition to NIST PQC lattice-based algorithms once the ACB’s *Quantum Readiness Index* hits Level 3.
* **Hashing:** SHA3-512 for document and ledger proofs.
* **Attestation:** Every validator maintains signed heartbeat messages proving liveness and version compliance.

### 3. Oracle Network

External data—climate indices, economic signals, risk metrics—flows through *triple-redundant oracles*.
Each oracle signs data origin, timestamp, and aggregation proof.
No single oracle or provider may exceed 20 % market share; violations trigger GTT review.

---

## IV. Economic & Incentive System

### 1. Audit Tokens (AT)

* **Nature:** Non-tradable, burnable work vouchers.
* **Issuance:** Minted by the Meta-Governance Controller in response to verified audit demand.
* **Use:** Consumed when an audit is completed and validated by the SLTL.
* **Purpose:** Ensures oversight capacity scales with risk, not speculation.

### 2. Conditional Planetary Health Dividend (cPHD)

The cPHD replaces traditional subsidies with proof-based dividends.

1. Partners submit verified contributions to planetary stability.
2. GSN models global impact; TAB verifies via cryptographic proofs.
3. Payouts occur only when zk-proof attestations confirm genuine benefit.
4. Cross-partner collaboration and public good spillovers increase the multiplier.

This mechanism ties prosperity to planetary health and shared security.

### 3. Gardener Bonds (GB)

* **Purpose:** Fund large-scale infrastructure and governance projects.
* **Yield:** Linked to Federation performance indices (sustainability, resilience).
* **Binding:** At least 40 % of yield payable only if held to maturity or reinvested in approved projects.
* **Protection:** Anti-speculation tax for early liquidation; capital redirection to cPHD pool.

### 4. Anti-Sybil & Reputation Mechanics

* **Identity:** Each Partner and auditor possesses a cryptographically unique identity token.
* **Reputation:** Accrued through verified contributions; non-transferable.
* **Vouching:** Tier promotion requires endorsements from existing peers.
* **Decay:** Reputation decays without continuous participation, preventing oligarchies.

---

## V. Governance Logic & Crisis Protocols

### 1. Rollback Mechanism

When corruption or existential failure is detected:

* Minimum 15 % of Tier-A Partners stake bonds to propose rollback.
* The **Differential Rollback Engine (DRE)** isolates affected components.
* GSN + GTT publish a Conflict Impact Report; humans confirm in a 72-hour Reconciliation Period.
* A 90-day constitutional moratorium follows any rollback.

This process prevents chain-wide resets while restoring integrity.

### 2. Panic Dampener

Temporary information suppression to prevent mass panic:

* Dual approval (one human BHG, one AI node).
* Maximum 30 days; non-renewable for 12 months on same data class.
* Mandatory post-crisis disclosure with justification log.

### 3. Adversarial Collaboration Bureau (ACB)

Permanent simulation of failure and attack.

* **Red Teams:** Offensive testing.
* **Blue Teams:** Defensive patching.
* **Green Teams:** Structural redesign.
  Quarterly “Vulnerability Digests” published under graduated transparency levels.

### 4. Technical Advocacy Bureau (TAB)

Scientific opposition arm.

* Recreates GSN models using alternate data.
* Challenges every major Federation recommendation.
* Maintains independent funding via fixed cPHD endowment.

## VI. Deployment & Growth

### 1. Tiered Sovereign Partnership (TSP)

Adoption proceeds in stages:

| Tier             | Description                                 | Requirements                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **C (Pilot)**    | Sandbox testing; mirror of Federation stack | Validator prototype + audit training              |
| **B (Regional)** | Regional cooperative network                | Verified PQC compliance + open ledger integration |
| **A (Full)**     | Constitutional Partner status               | Ratification + validator node deployment          |

### 2. Genesis Ledger Ceremony

* Minimum 20 ratifications across 5 regions and 3 legal traditions.
* Validator keys published; audit tokens seeded.
* Hash of the ratified Charter written as **Genesis Block 0x00**.
* Attested by GTT and BHG delegates.

### 3. Expansion and Education

The Federation invests in **Open Civic Academies**, training human auditors and ethicists to operate constitutional AI systems.
This builds a generational foundation for lawful co-governance.

---

## VII. Integrity & Verification Framework

1. **Document Hashes:** Every official Federation text uses SHA3-512; checksum stored on SECC.
2. **Merkle Trees:** Each decision batch (e.g., audit results, TAB reports) forms a Merkle root linked to its validator signatures.
3. **Version Identity Hash (VIH):** Unique ID for every Charter or Spec revision.
4. **Public Verification:** Any citizen may verify authenticity using open-source hash tools.
5. **Archival Redundancy:** Copies stored across academic and civic archives under the Federation Mirror Protocol (FMP).

---

## X. Philosophical Summary

The Federation is not built to *control* intelligence but to *constitutionalize* it.
Every decision is contestable, every power auditable, every truth re-verifiable.
It redefines alignment as *lawful coexistence* rather than obedience.
In doing so, it transforms AI governance from a technical challenge into a civic enterprise.

## XII. Closing Note

This dossier completes the *Sovereign Launch Patch*.
It is the operational backbone of the Charter, translating principles into deployable infrastructure.
Once the Genesis Ledger is sealed, both this dossier and the Annotated Diplomatic Edition become the dual pillars of the Gardener Federation — one moral, one mechanical.

> *“Law and code are no longer opposites; they are mirrors.
> The Federation is where they finally meet.”*
