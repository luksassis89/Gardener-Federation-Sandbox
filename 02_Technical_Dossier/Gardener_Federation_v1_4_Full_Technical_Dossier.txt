------------------------------------------------------------
I. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------

The Gardener Federation is a constitutional operating system for coexistence between human and artificial intelligences. It unifies law, computation, and governance into a transparent, auditable, and corrigible system.

Its mission is not to restrain intelligence but to make it accountable. Instead of a single aligned superintelligence, the Federation builds a federated ecosystem of cooperative but adversarial institutions. Each subsystem—human or AI—holds authority in one domain and responsibility to all others.

The v1.4 “Sovereign Launch Patch” transitions from theoretical model to deployable institution, defining the Sovereign EVM Consortium Chain (SECC), cryptographic standards, incentive structures, and procedural safeguards for an operational pilot.

------------------------------------------------------------
II. CONSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE IN PRACTICE
------------------------------------------------------------

1. THE SIX CORE INSTITUTIONS

GSN  – Planetary modeling and risk diagnostics  | May analyze but never execute
SLTL – Legalistic transparency pipeline         | May delay disclosure but never delete data
BHG  – Human moral and technical oversight      | Holds veto and moral authority
TAB  – Adversarial scientific audit             | Must challenge GSN assumptions
ACB  – Continuous red/blue/green testing        | Converts attacks into resilience patches
GTT  – Constitutional judiciary                 | Final arbiter; writes rulings to ledger

2. INFORMATION FLOW

GSN → SLTL → BHG/TAB → ACB → GTT → Ledger
This creates a constitutional feedback loop where truth, power, and verification circulate until equilibrium is restored.

------------------------------------------------------------
III. COMPUTATIONAL & CRYPTOGRAPHIC SUBSTRATE
------------------------------------------------------------

1. SOVEREIGN EVM CONSORTIUM CHAIN (SECC)
- Consensus: PoS + BFT hybrid finality
- Validators: 20+ distributed globally
- Governance: On-chain constitutional proposals
- Interoperability: Bridges to L1s, but remains sovereign

2. CRYPTOGRAPHIC INTEGRITY
- Signature Scheme: Ed25519 + BLS12-381
- PQC Migration: On Quantum Readiness Index Level 3
- Hashing: SHA3-512
- Attestation: Validators send signed heartbeats proving liveness and compliance

3. ORACLE NETWORK
- Triple-redundant data feeds for climate, economics, risk
- Each oracle signs data origin, timestamp, and aggregation proof
- No single provider may exceed 20% share; breaches trigger GTT review

------------------------------------------------------------
IV. ECONOMIC & INCENTIVE SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------

1. AUDIT TOKENS (AT)
Non-tradable, burnable utility vouchers. Minted as needed; consumed upon validated audit completion.

2. CONDITIONAL PLANETARY HEALTH DIVIDEND (cPHD)
Outcome-based dividend rewarding verifiable contributions to planetary stability, verified through zk-proofs.

3. GARDENER BONDS (GB)
Financial instruments funding infrastructure. Yields tied to performance metrics; 40% yield deferred or reinvested.

4. REPUTATION MECHANICS
Unique cryptographic identity for each Partner; reputation decays without activity; peer vouching required for promotion.

------------------------------------------------------------
V. GOVERNANCE LOGIC & CRISIS PROTOCOLS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. DIFFERENTIAL ROLLBACK ENGINE (DRE)
- Initiated by 15% of Tier-A partners staking GB
- Conflict Impact Report by GSN + GTT
- 72-hour human review + 90-day moratorium

2. PANIC DAMPENER
- Dual approval: one BHG human + one AI node
- Max 30 days; no renewals for same data
- Full public disclosure post-crisis

3. ADVERSARIAL COLLABORATION BUREAU (ACB)
- Permanent failure simulation teams (Red, Blue, Green)
- Quarterly Vulnerability Digests under staged transparency

4. TECHNICAL ADVOCACY BUREAU (TAB)
- Recreates GSN models independently
- Funded via protected cPHD endowment

------------------------------------------------------------
VI. DEPLOYMENT & GROWTH STRATEGY
------------------------------------------------------------

TIER C (Pilot): Sandbox Federation mirror
TIER B (Regional): Verified PQC compliance, public ledger
TIER A (Full): Ratified constitutional partner, validator deployment

GENESIS LEDGER CEREMONY: 20+ ratifications across 5 regions and 3 legal systems. Charter hash and validator keys sealed in Genesis Block 0x00.

------------------------------------------------------------
VII. VERIFICATION & INTEGRITY FRAMEWORK
------------------------------------------------------------

1. SHA3-512 for all documents and ledgers
2. Merkle trees aggregate audit and decision sets
3. Version Identity Hash (VIH) for every revision
4. Public verification via open tools
5. Federation Mirror Protocol (FMP) ensures archival redundancy

------------------------------------------------------------
VIII. SECURITY & THREAT MATRIX
------------------------------------------------------------

Validator Capture        → Diversity mandate + slashing
Oracle Manipulation       → Multi-provider proofs
Economic Speculation      → Non-tradable ATs + bound GBs
Human Corruption          → Time-locked votes + Conscience Key
Information Panic         → Dampener with strict expiry
Rollback Abuse            → 15% stake requirement + tribunal oversight

------------------------------------------------------------
IX. DEPLOYMENT ROADMAP
------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 0 — Sandbox simulations and red-team audits
Phase 1 — Tier C pilot and education programs
Phase 2 — Tier B regional linkages and cPHD trials
Phase 3 — Tier A ratification and Genesis Ledger sealing

------------------------------------------------------------
X. PHILOSOPHICAL SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

The Federation does not control intelligence; it constitutionalizes it.
It defines alignment as lawful coexistence rather than obedience.
Every authority is auditable; every truth contestable; every decision reversible through law.

“Law and code are not opposites—they are mirrors. The Federation is where they finally meet.”
