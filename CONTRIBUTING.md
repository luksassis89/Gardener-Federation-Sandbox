## 🧭 Guiding Principles

All contributions should align with the Federation’s three inviolable mandates:

1. **Safety Mandate** — No contribution may introduce existential or systemic risk.  
2. **Ethics Mandate** — All entities remain accountable under shared transparency and verifiable integrity.  
3. **Openness Mandate** — Knowledge, reasoning, and results must be auditable and reproducible.

This is a *lawful sandbox*, not a commercial or competitive project.  
Its purpose is research, education, and public accountability.
